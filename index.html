<h1><em>spuug</em> - a tool to generate GObjects</h1>

<tt>spuug</tt> is a little tool that generates the boilerplate code for <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobject" >GObject</a>s. If you don't know
what they are, then probably this tool is not for you...

<p><tt>spuug</tt> can be used for 'plain' GObjects, but also for GTK+-widgets
etc., and tries to be a bit smart with the code in spits out. I've been using
it myself for a while, and it has been very helpful. However, a code generator
is no more than that -- you still need to understand GObjects/GtkWidgets to
use it. So, I would recommend writing a couple 'by hand' before using a tool
like this one.

<p>If you find any problems or you have improvements, please report them to
meÂ·

<p><strong>Update:</strong> 24.12.2008: a new version 0.3 is available, mostly
due to a patch from Viktor Nagy -- thanks!

spuug is a script to generate GObject boilerplate code
usage: spuug [OPTIONS]
where options are:
	--class=<classname>,-c         : the classname (e.g. MyFooBar)
	--interface=<interface>,-i     : the interface name (e.g. MyFooBarIFace)
	--parent=<parent-classname>,-p : the parent classname (e.g. Bar)
	--namespace=<namespace>,-n     : the namespace (e.g. My)
	--test,-t                      : generate test code as well
	--force,-f                     : overwrite existing files
	--help,-h                      : show this help text

Example:
	$ spuug --class=FunkyFooBar --namespace=Funky --parent=GtkWidget
will generate funky-foobar.c and funky-foobar.h with the boilerplate code

and
	$ spuug --class=CuteThing --namespace=Cute --parent=GObject --test
will generate cute-thing.c and cute-thing.h with the boilerplate code,
and test-cute-thing.c and Makefile for testing</pre>
