<h1><em>spuug</em> - a tool to generate GObjects</h1>

<tt>spuug</tt> is a little tool that generates the boilerplate code for <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobject" >GObject</a>s. I you don't know
what they are, then probably this tool is of little use to you...

<p><tt>spuug</tt> can be used for 'plain' GObjects, but also for GTK+-widgets
etc., and tries to be a bit smart with the code in spits out. I've been using
it myself for a while, and it has been very helpful. However, a code generator
is no more than that -- you still need to understand GObjects/GtkWidgets to
use it. So, I would recommend writing a couple 'by hand' before using a tool
like this one.

<p>If you find any problems or you have improvements, please report them to
meÂ·

<p><em>spuug</em> is Dutch for the imperative form of <em>to spit out</em>

spuug is a script to generate GObject boilerplate code
usage: spuug [OPTIONS]
where options are:
<table>
<tr><td>   --class=<classname>,-c          <td>: the classname (e.g. MyFooBar)
<tr><td>   --interface=<interface>,-i      <td>: the interface name (e.g. MyFooBarIFace)
<tr><td>   --parent=<parent-classname>,-p  <td>: the parent classname (e.g. Bar)
<tr><td>   --namespace=<namespace>,-n      <td>: the namespace (e.g. My)
<tr><td>   --test,-t                       <td>: generate test code as well
<tr><td>   --force,-f                      <td>: overwrite existing files
<tr><td>   --help,-h                       <td>: show this help text
</table>
Example:
        $ spuug --class=FunkyFooBar --namespace=Funky --parent=GtkWidget
will generate funky-foobar.c and funky-foobar.h with the boilerplate code

and
        $ spuug --class=CuteThing --namespace=Cute --parent=GObject --test
will generate cute-thing.c and cute-thing.h with the boilerplate code,
and test-cute-thing.c and Makefile for testing
